FTC_2014-2015
=============

The code for 'Oly Cow's 2014-2015 robot.

There will (possibly) (at some point in the (distant) future) be complete documentation
for all the code contained here. Meanwhile, feel free to email team 'Oly Cow for any help
you might need (mooovingforward [at] gmail [dot] com).

We provide this code without any warranty that it will work. Of course, you don't care
because you don't have an exact replica of our robot. Furthermore, our robot is constantly
changing as the season goes on, and there is never a final version of our robot. As a
consequence, code from commits earlier in the season often cannot simply be rolled back.
Instead, the version control is there to provide a template or backup in case something
goes wrong which we need to fix.

Good luck, and we hope you will be able to use this code for improving your own designs.
